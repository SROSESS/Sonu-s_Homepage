        <h1>My website is sitting house next to a river of knowledge what could be yours be? </h1>
        <h2>Laurel Scahwarst</h2>
        
        <p>While I was reading Lauren's article, it made me wonder: why do we need websites today? To me, a website or social media account is a vessel for passing information and knowledge to everyone on the web. It's fascinating to be in a world where we can easily access information and be inspired, or try to recreate what others have done. </p>

        <h1>Rant About Technology</h1>
        <h2>Urssula K.le Guin</h2>
        <p>I can't imagine a world living without technology for me. As a 2000s kid growing up in the rise of technology, from my computer to having a laptop that I am typing on now, I can't imagine a world without it. But sometimes I have heard from my grandparents saying, "Can you live without your technology for once?" That kind of made me realize how life without technology could have been. Without a smartphone or any electrical appliance, how would people live with it? I guess it might have been easier during that time since they had to rely on other things even though it was hard. But I think living in today's world, technology plays a huge role in everyone's life.</p>

        <h1>"Hello,World!</h1>
        <h2>Taeyoon Choi</h2>
        <p>There's always a thrill in making homemade websites or anything crafty. I enjoy making both of them. Even though when I heard this class is known for homemade website, it kind of got me interested and wondered by this homemade website class. Upon learning the first few classes, I realized the real meaning behind "Web design: Homemade website" is simply because we are actually making this website from scratch, just like making a homemade candle from scratch. There's definitely a joy and happiness in doing both because it's simply organic.</p>
